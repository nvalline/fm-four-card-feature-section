## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good challenge that made me utilize CSS Grid in a way that I haven't done very often. I needed to tap into the community Discord to remember how to arange the cards for the desktop view.

### Continued development

CSS Grid is a feature that I want to continue to learn to the point it is second nature.
